Coffee Conversations
--------------------

For the Montessori community of practice, we want to offer more opportunities to share our delights and our struggles, to see people who are working passionately and get in a good laugh, to debate real issues and get real help. Our goal is to go past connecting at big events, to go deeper than social get-togethers, to root and inspire our practice in local Montessori conspirators.  To that end, we'll be holding "coffee conversations" in both Seattle and Portland. The first few coffess will lead up to our conference. After you attend one, you may be tempted to bring this format back to your own school too!

### Upcoming coffees


<table class="table table-striped">
{% for coffee in page.coffees %}
<tr>
<td>{{ coffee.when }}</td>
<td>{{ coffee.where }}</td>
<td>{% if coffee.rsvp %}<a href="{{ coffee.rsvp }}" class="btn btn-primary">RSVP</a>{% endif %}</td>
</tr>
{% endfor %}
</table>

### How will it work?

We'll be using a discussion format called [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org). It's an easy way to have a structured conversation. We think it will give you an idea of what will be possible in the conference and help us all to get to know each other better.

<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Write your idea on a post-it</h4>
    Everyone writes Montessori topics + questions on post-its. You might ask "How do you manage transitions?" or "How do you handle conflict in the classroom?".</li>
  <li>
    <h4>Vote for your favorite ideas</h4>
    Quickly, everyone will put a dot on the post-its that they would like to talk about. Ideas then get sorted by how many dots they have.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Learn and share!</h4>
    Talk about what's important. Each idea gets 8 minutes, and then a quick check to see if we should spend more time or move to the next idea.
  </li>
</ol>
