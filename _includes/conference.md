Conference
----------

Have you had the experience of going to a big conference, only to discover that the times you have your best ideas and inspirations are the breaks? The times when you get to talk to your friends about stories, problems, and joys are often the most meaningful of all. This conference is designed to be entirely made up of those types of experiences!

### How will it work?

We'll be using Open Space Technology to hold this conference. What does that look like?

First we'll get together in a circle and people (that's you) will announce the sessions you would like to hold over the time we are together. We'll post all those sessions to a giant wall which will serve as our "marketplace" of ideas. Then you get to spend the rest of the conference going back and forth between way too many great sessions.
