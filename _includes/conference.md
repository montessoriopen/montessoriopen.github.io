Conference
----------

We all know that the best part of conferences are the breaks, when you get to talk to your friends about stories, problems, and joys. This conference is designed to be 2 full days of just that!

### How will it work?

We'll be using Open Space Technology to hold this conference. What does that look like?

First we'll get together in a circle and people (that's you) will announce the sessions you would like to hold over the time we are together. We'll post all those sessions to a giant wall which will serve as our "marketplace" of ideas. Then you get to spend the rest of the conference going back and forth between way too many great sessions.
