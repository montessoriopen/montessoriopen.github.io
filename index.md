## Who are we?

<div class="row" markdown="1">
<div class="col-sm-8" markdown="1">

My name is Karissa Lightsmith. From a classroom assistant to a founder and head of school, one vision has driven me to keep dreaming and scheming in the Montessori tradition.  My vision is to provide many tools and support systems for adults, so they may both 1) respect and aid all our children in their achademic, social, and spiritual development and 2) enojoy the sweet joy and delight of their company. Founding and heading [Lighthouse Montessori](http://lighthousemontessori.com) is a dream-fullfilling step towards that goal and this is my next step.

It is so easy to be bogged down, caught up in the present, or just out of time in our field. I see two vital reasons to use our valuable time and be together: 1) Montessori is an oral tradition, so much history, techniques, experience, and fantastic ideas will be lost if we don't talk to each other. 2) This work requries its practitioners to devote their entire selves. This work is deeply personal, life transforming, and incredibly demending. We need a community to support us in this undertaking! 

Let's get together and share what we do!

I am commited to seeing this work happen in my home and around the world. To see this happen I need your help! If you're passionate about this and want to help, I would love you to be involved in anyway that fits your availability and interest. You might

1. Attend any of these events!
2. Host a social event during the conference weekend
3. Tell fellow Montessorians about these gatherings
4. Host a Lean Coffee Conversation
5. Co-organize aspects of the Open Space conference with me
